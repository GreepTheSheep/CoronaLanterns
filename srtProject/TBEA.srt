1
00:00:04,731 --> 00:00:07,065
Flynn Rider: <i>This is the
story of how I died...</i>

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,445
<i>and went to heaven!</i> (chuckles)

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,670
<i>Okay, so the Kingdom of Corona,
to be exact,</i>

4
00:00:12,706 --> 00:00:15,440
<i>but hey, let's not get hung up
on semantics.</i>

5
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:17,342
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

6
00:00:17,377 --> 00:00:20,345
<i>a single drop of sunlight
fell from the heavens...</i>

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,612
<i>You know what?</i>

8
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:24,382
<i>I'm just gonna give you
the rapid-fire shorthand here.</i>

9
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:27,418
<i>The sundrop created a golden
flower with healing powers,</i>

10
00:00:27,454 --> 00:00:30,688
<i>creepy, old, Mother Gothel sang a song
to said flower to regain her youth.</i>

11
00:00:30,724 --> 00:00:33,591
<i>Yada, yada, yada, the queen
got sick, flower healed queen,</i>

12
00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:36,728
<i>queen gave birth to Rapunzel, who was born
with the flower's magical healing powers,</i>

13
00:00:36,763 --> 00:00:39,664
<i>and everything was all flying
lanterns and cheering subjects,</i>

14
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:42,533
<i>until... Gothel stole the princess</i>

15
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:45,503
<i>and kept her locked in a tower
for 18 long years.</i>

16
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:47,772
<i>Then the princess was rescued</i>

17
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:51,309
<i>by a dashing, steely-eyed,
suave, smoldering,</i>

18
00:00:51,344 --> 00:00:53,444
<i>devilishly charming rogue.</i>

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,513
<i>Now, some people might
have called him a thief,</i>

20
00:00:55,548 --> 00:00:59,517
<i>but I always preferred the term
"misunderstood good guy."</i>

21
00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:01,586
<i>You see, it wasn't always easy
for young Eugene.</i>

22
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:03,688
<i>Raised as an orphan
on the rough streets of...</i>

23
00:01:03,723 --> 00:01:06,324
Rapunzel: <i>Hey, Eugene. Focus?</i>

24
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,525
Eugene: <i>Huh? Oh, right. Sorry.</i>

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,694
<i>So, the beautiful
young maiden, that's you,</i>

26
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:12,463
<i>and the handsome rogue,
that's me, made a deal.</i>

27
00:01:12,499 --> 00:01:15,299
<i>We followed some lanterns,
I saved you from Gothel,</i>

28
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:17,468
<i>you saved me from... death,</i>

29
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:20,471
<i>and then you got arguably the world's
most overly dramatic haircut.</i>

30
00:01:20,507 --> 00:01:22,373
<i>- And then...</i>
- Rapunzel: <i>And then,</i>

31
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,475
<i>I was reunited with my long-lost family.</i>

32
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:27,378
<i>But that is where our new story began.</i>

33
00:01:27,414 --> 00:01:28,613
<i>Six months had passed,</i>

34
00:01:28,648 --> 00:01:31,416
<i>I was loving life
inside the Kingdom of Corona,</i>

35
00:01:31,451 --> 00:01:34,452
<i>and my coronation
to officially become princess</i>

36
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:35,720
<i>had finally come.</i>

37
00:01:35,755 --> 00:01:37,688
Eugene: <i>We all had a few
surprises that day.</i>

38
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:39,690
<i>- Didn't we, sunshine?</i>
- (Pascal squeaks)

39
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:41,325
Eugene: <i>Laugh it up, frog.</i>

40
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:42,627
Rapunzel: <i>Now, I know
what you're all thinking.</i>

41
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:44,662
<i>Yes, Eugene and I did get married.</i>

42
00:01:44,697 --> 00:01:46,531
<i>But make no mistake,</i>

43
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:49,567
<i>getting to the wedding day
and our happily ever after</i>

44
00:01:49,602 --> 00:01:52,770
<i>would be the biggest adventure
we would ever face.</i>

45
00:01:52,806 --> 00:01:54,338
Eugene: <i>Oh, that's good.</i>

46
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:03,681
They're gaining on us.

47
00:02:06,352 --> 00:02:07,485
There's more of them!

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,320
Good. It'll keep things interesting.

49
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:16,360
Man, these guys are persistent.

50
00:02:16,396 --> 00:02:18,329
So am I. I'll meet you at the wall.

51
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:19,630
Sounds like a challenge.

52
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,265
Think you can keep up?

53
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:23,401
Oh, it's not me you have to worry about.

54
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:24,469
Uh-oh.

55
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:27,405
They're your problem now.

56
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:30,675
Oh, great.

57
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,646
Okay, Max, follow my lead...

58
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:37,415
Oh, log, log, log!

59
00:02:41,588 --> 00:02:44,589
Ooh, good thing
the ground broke his fall.

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,695
- (squeaks) Huh?
- Whoa, bunny crossing!

61
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,598
Careful Fidela, watch out,
watch out. Cute little bunnies.

62
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:55,500
- (horse grunts)
- (bunnies squeak)

63
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:04,509
You're not getting away this time!

64
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:06,377
- Rapunzel: Hiya!
- (whinnies)

65
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:07,545
Sorry.

66
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,480
We're almost there.

67
00:03:09,516 --> 00:03:10,681
Oh, come on!

68
00:03:15,588 --> 00:03:17,522
Rapunzel: Whoo-hoo!

69
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:23,261
(whickers)

70
00:03:23,296 --> 00:03:25,463
- (groans)
- (grunts)

71
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,565
- Looking good, Cap.
- (whinnies)

72
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:36,507
(whickers) Huh?

73
00:03:45,418 --> 00:03:50,555
(sighs) Pascal, look at that view.

74
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,757
(sighs)

75
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:54,559
Haha!

76
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,730
Okay, okay, I know what you're thinking.

77
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:01,766
Now, it may have seemed like you won,

78
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:03,501
but you gotta take
into account that my hair

79
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:05,469
is actually longer than yours now,

80
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:07,405
so we gotta factor in wind resistance.

81
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,574
Hmm. Wow.

82
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:13,668
Have you ever seen
anything so beautiful?

83
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:18,583
Yes. Yes, I have.

84
00:04:20,453 --> 00:04:21,686
Captain: The game's over, Your Highness.

85
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:24,455
The welcoming ceremony
is about to begin.

86
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,425
Well, I think we showed
those guards who's boss.

87
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,562
Now, what do you say we go
make you an official princess?

88
00:04:31,598 --> 00:04:34,432
Oh, is that today?

89
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:36,267
Haha, very funny.

90
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:37,735
Now come on, we better get
you back to the castle.

91
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,706
Ooh, maybe I can squeeze in
a royal massage.

92
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,741
Before my daily trim, of course.

93
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:46,577
(squeaks)

94
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:49,642
I know, Pascal.
We'll get out there soon.

95
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:53,551
Ha. Race you back to the castle.

96
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:56,320
(sighs)

97
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:09,667
Rapunzel: <i>♪ This is life

That's enough. I'll take it from here.

116
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:06,490
How you holding up?

117
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:08,225
Busy.

118
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:10,227
But busy is good.

119
00:06:10,263 --> 00:06:11,395
I'm glad you think so, Raps,

120
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:14,298
'cause this welcoming ceremony
is just the beginning.

121
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:16,500
Tomorrow's the festival,
followed by the royal banquet,

122
00:06:16,536 --> 00:06:19,270
and that's all before the
actual coronation on Sunday.

123
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:22,373
Oh, come on, really?

124
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:24,709
Look, Rapunzel, I know this
princess thing is new to you,

125
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:27,478
but you've got to at least
try to act the part.

126
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:28,679
Trust me, Cassandra,

127
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:31,482
I know how important this is to my dad.

128
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,317
As you've requested, Your Majesty,

129
00:06:33,353 --> 00:06:34,518
we've doubled security on both

130
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:36,320
the main gates and the south towers.

131
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:38,622
Good. We have guests
from all over the world.

132
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:40,491
I want them to know that they are safe.

133
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:42,660
Everything for my little girl's
coronation weekend

134
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:45,262
must be absolutely perfect.

135
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:46,397

141
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,352
Now, as princess, you are not only
representing yourself and the family,

142
00:07:08,388 --> 00:07:09,587
but all of Corona.

143
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:12,523
Don't worry, Dad. I won't let you down.

144
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,593
But while we're on the whole
princess, coronation thingy,

145
00:07:15,628 --> 00:07:19,230
I mean, all these royal
activities are great,

146
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:21,399
but do you think I might be able

147
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:23,234
to catch a little downtime soon?

148
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:25,603
I know this is all new,
but you'll adjust.

149
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:28,372
After all, your friend seems

150
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:30,307
to be getting on just fine.

151
00:07:30,343 --> 00:07:32,510
Ooh-hoo-hoo, Helmut, my man,

152
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:34,612
this hat ties the whole outfit together.

153
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:36,414
Now, I know what you're all thinking.

154
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:38,516

a good mood today?

155
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:39,617

Just introducing myself

184
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:26,223
to the most important
people in the world.

185
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:28,325
Representing my mom, dad,

186
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:30,628
and the entire kingdom.

187
00:09:30,663 --> 00:09:33,297
We got this.

188
00:09:39,505 --> 00:09:41,372
(rat squeaking)

189
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,720
Lady Caine, what is it?

190
00:09:57,757 --> 00:10:01,792
Time to pay our respects
to our beloved royals.

191
00:10:02,862 --> 00:10:06,630
(fanfare playing)

192
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,533
We're good at making
people feel welcome.

193
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:13,771
This is completely doable... ish.

194
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,878
(clears throat)

195
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:30,721
Your Highness, I present

196
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:34,492
Dame Elizabeth Van Hoskins of Rochester.

197
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:36,827
(grunting)

198
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:38,796
Get in here!

199
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:41,699
So nice to meet you.

200
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,468
(squeaks)

201
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:53,511
Um, perhaps you should refrain
from the bear hugs, sweetheart.

202
00:10:53,546 --> 00:10:57,581
Oh, no bear hugs. Gotcha. Sorry.

203
00:10:57,617 --> 00:11:02,853
I present Lieutenant Commander
General James Rutherford-Carver III.

204
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:05,656
Phew. That's kind of a mouthful.

205
00:11:05,691 --> 00:11:07,491
Is it okay if I call you Jimmy?

206
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:09,527
I'd prefer you didn't.

207
00:11:09,562 --> 00:11:10,761
Well, um...

208
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,830
Welcome all the same then.

209
00:11:12,865 --> 00:11:16,467
MC: I present the Duchess of Quintonia.

210
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:19,803
Wow, can I just say, I love your hair.

211
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,672
I used to have
really long hair too, but...

212
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:24,475
This is a handwoven coiffure

213
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,511
weft from the finest silk
and Vacuna fabrics.

214
00:11:27,547 --> 00:11:29,713
It designates high social status.

215
00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:31,782
You think you'd know that.

216
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:35,753
Uh, still. Nice to meet you.

217
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:39,557
Sadly not nice enough
to wear shoes, I'm afraid.

218
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:40,925
(laughs)

219
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,693
Really.

220
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:43,861
(huffs)

221
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:48,499
(whispers) Sorry.

222
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:01,946
So, I think we learned
something very valuable today.

223
00:12:01,981 --> 00:12:04,515
There's a time and place for bear hugs.

224
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,883
(both chuckle)

225
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,552
Hey, are you okay?

226
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:11,522
Yeah, great. Why wouldn't I be?

227
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:15,459
(sighs) It's just...

228
00:12:15,494 --> 00:12:18,762
Eugene, is all this everything
you dreamed it would be?

229
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,634
Rapunzel, you are my dream.

230
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:25,536
So as long as you're with me,

231
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:28,439
that answer's always gonna be yes.

232
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:29,640
Why? Don't you feel the same way?

233
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:30,874
No... Ye-Yes!

234
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,576
I mean, of course I do!

235
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:36,614
I love you with all my heart, Eugene.

236
00:12:37,817 --> 00:12:39,750
Look, I know this has got be weird.

237
00:12:39,785 --> 00:12:42,586
No one's expecting you
to take it all in overnight.

238
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:44,755
But believe me, I've been
all around the world

239
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,557
and it doesn't get any better than this.

240
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:49,727
This castle, our friends,
your family, each other.

241
00:12:49,762 --> 00:12:50,928
What else could you possibly want?

242
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,465
Nothing.

243
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:56,600
Time to go!

244
00:12:57,837 --> 00:12:59,503
(coughs)

245
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:01,672
(scoffs) How's
that water feeling, Fitzherbert?

246
00:13:01,707 --> 00:13:04,675
(panting) Dark and icy.

247
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,443
Just like you.

248
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:08,812
(chuckles) Come on, Rapunzel,
it's time to head in.

249
00:13:08,848 --> 00:13:10,781
You don't want to be
exhausted for tomorrow.

250
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:13,417
Right! My morning off!

251
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,587
Sorry!

252
00:13:21,794 --> 00:13:23,560
Man, she scares me.

253
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:35,739
(trumpet playing fanfare)

254
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:39,910
The princess, Rapunzel,
will spend her day about town!

255
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:43,914
- (grunts)
- (squeaks)

256
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:49,520
(grunts)

257
00:14:02,902 --> 00:14:03,867
Oh!

258
00:14:03,903 --> 00:14:06,804
(grunting)

259
00:14:18,617 --> 00:14:19,583
(sniffs)

260
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,492
Let me guess.

261
00:14:28,527 --> 00:14:30,627
Big day on the town
wasn't all you hoped it'd be?

262
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:33,597
(sighs) It was... interesting.

263
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:34,798
(squeaks, sputters)

264
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,433
Uh huh, I bet.

265
00:14:36,469 --> 00:14:39,770
I just wish my dad would let me
get out and see the real world.

266
00:14:39,805 --> 00:14:41,839
You know, if you really wanted,

267
00:14:41,874 --> 00:14:43,607
I could get you in and out of here

268
00:14:43,642 --> 00:14:46,443
before anyone even knew
that we were gone.

269
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:47,511
(squeaks)

270
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:49,780
Uh, you mean sneak me out?

271
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:50,914
Exactly.

272
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,584
What you do when no one's
looking is your business.

273
00:14:54,787 --> 00:14:55,986
(knock on door)

274
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,889
Woman: The royal banquet is ready
to receive the princess now.

275
00:14:58,924 --> 00:15:00,724
Cheer up, Raps.

276
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,893
Hey, maybe your dad got someone
to chew your food for you.

277
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:17,541
(boy laughs)

278
00:15:17,576 --> 00:15:19,777
I'm in charge of the seating charts.

279
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:21,411
One of the perks of the job.

280
00:15:21,447 --> 00:15:22,546
(giggling)

281
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:24,782
I don't understand why
you are so upset, sweetheart.

282
00:15:24,817 --> 00:15:26,784
I said you could do whatever you wanted.

283
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:27,985
That's exactly what you did.

284
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:32,656
Hmm, you didn't say anything
about a battalion tagging along.

285
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:33,891
Why would I need to?

286
00:15:33,926 --> 00:15:35,492
You're royalty,

287
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:37,427
making a public appearance.

288
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:38,896
- But, Dad...
- (Eugene clears throat)

289
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:41,598
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dukes and Duchesses,

290
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:42,766
Barons and Baronesses,

291
00:15:42,802 --> 00:15:46,537
Marquis and, you know,
the female version of those,

292
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,906
may I share a moment
of history with you.

293
00:15:48,941 --> 00:15:51,642
Princess, would you join me up here?

294
00:15:55,648 --> 00:15:57,848
Tonight, we celebrate
our love for the princess.

295
00:15:57,883 --> 00:16:00,484
I, for one, can think of no better way

296
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,820
to celebrate the love I have
for this woman than this.

297
00:16:05,457 --> 00:16:06,456
(squawks)

298
00:16:06,492 --> 00:16:08,725
Oh, Eugene!
Wait. Did you drop something?

299
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:09,860
No.

300
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:17,601
Rapunzel, from the moment
I first met you

301
00:16:17,636 --> 00:16:20,571
and you knocked me out
with that frying pan,

302
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:21,705
I knew it was love.

303
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,774
You're my light, you're my best friend

304
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:25,776
and I want to be
your partner in all things.

305
00:16:27,713 --> 00:16:30,747
I can't wait to laugh
with you and share with you.

306
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:32,749
I see us raising our children here,

307
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:34,518
and our children's children,

308
00:16:34,553 --> 00:16:36,787
and celebrating banquets
of our own in this very hall

309
00:16:36,822 --> 00:16:41,825
for many, many, many,
many years to come.

310
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:44,595
I want to ride our horses
out to the Corona wall together

311
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,431
each and every morning
until we're both very,

312
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,900
very old and gray.

313
00:16:49,935 --> 00:16:51,902
I love you, Rapunzel,

314
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:55,606
and I want to spend the rest
of our lives here together.

315
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,475
Here? In this...

316
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,677
castle forever?

317
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:02,446
I mean, unless you want to rent,

318
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,381
but I hardly see how
we're going to top this.

319
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,650
Eugene: <i>And I want to spend the
rest of my life with you here,</i>

320
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:08,852
<i>and it doesn't get any better
than this, this castle...</i>

321
00:17:08,888 --> 00:17:12,656
King Frederic: <i>Princesses need
to be protected at all times.</i>

322
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:15,659
Rapunzel? Rapunzel?

323
00:17:15,694 --> 00:17:18,762
(sighs) I've... Wow!

324
00:17:18,797 --> 00:17:22,466
I love you, Eugene, but...

325
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:23,667
but I can't!

326
00:17:23,702 --> 00:17:25,636
Just not, not now.

327
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,505
Um, I need some air.

328
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,741
(guests gasp, murmur)

329
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,517
Oh, I feel horrible about Eugene.

330
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:42,719
I... I do love him,

331
00:17:42,755 --> 00:17:44,788
and I wanna marry him someday...

332
00:17:44,823 --> 00:17:46,523
but not like this!

333
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:49,726
Ugh! I need to get out and clear my head

334
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:52,529
without a fleet of guards tailing me.

335
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:53,864
Say no more.

336
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:57,668
(gasps) Whoa!

337
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:01,605
Where's the war?

338
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,541
Well, when your dad is
captain of the guards,

339
00:18:04,576 --> 00:18:07,411
you tend to collect stuff.

340
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:11,748
(tings, thunks)

341
00:18:18,657 --> 00:18:21,825
I have a feeling
this is going to be fun.

342
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,794
Pascal, I need you to stay here

343
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:26,430
and make sure no one knows I'm gone.

344
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,028
The princess's lady-in-waiting
made it expressly clear...

345
00:18:37,053 --> 00:18:38,508
Lady in wait...

346
00:18:38,544 --> 00:18:40,477
What? You mean Cassandra?

347
00:18:40,512 --> 00:18:42,813
First off, calling Cassandra
a "lady" anything,

348
00:18:42,848 --> 00:18:44,848
is being incredibly generous.

349
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:46,783
Secondly, come on, Stan.

350
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:49,586
It's me, your buddy, Eugene.

351
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:51,521
Eugene the fiend.

352
00:18:51,557 --> 00:18:53,857
You know Rapunzel would want
to talk to me if you let me in.

353
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:55,792
Sorry, Eugene, orders are orders.

354
00:18:55,828 --> 00:18:59,830
All right. Just doing your job.
I respect that.

355
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:02,432
You sure there's no way to let me in?

356
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,706
Rapunzel?

357
00:19:09,742 --> 00:19:11,441
(squeaks)

358
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:12,776
Rapunzel?

359
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:17,781
There you are, um...

360
00:19:17,816 --> 00:19:19,750
Look, Rapunzel, I am sorry.

361
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:22,719
I am sorry, I should never have
put you on the spot like that.

362
00:19:23,822 --> 00:19:25,822
But I want you to know, I meant it.

363
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:28,492
I want to marry you, I love you.

364
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:32,863
It's okay, you're still upset,
I understand.

365
00:19:32,898 --> 00:19:35,732
You're not ready to say it back yet.

366
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:37,501
Totally cool.

367
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:40,804
Oh man, that is a good pillow!

368
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:41,872
What is that, goose down?

369
00:19:41,907 --> 00:19:43,573
Some kind of down?

370
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:45,509
Horse hair? Alpaca?

371
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:48,645
Sorry, look...

372
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,881
I know there's still a ton of
details we need to figure out...

373
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,783
and I may have jumped the gun a little.

374
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,551
It's just that...

375
00:19:54,586 --> 00:19:57,487
growing up poor and alone...

376
00:19:57,523 --> 00:19:59,656
I got used to having nothing.

377
00:19:59,691 --> 00:20:01,691
But now with you,

378
00:20:01,727 --> 00:20:03,627
I finally have something,
you know? We have something.

379
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:04,895
Something that is amazing.

380
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,697
And I guess tonight I was just
trying to keep it that way.

381
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:09,900
And I thought that's what
you wanted too,

382
00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:11,835
but I guess I was wrong.

383
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,571
(squeaks)

384
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:17,541
Oh come on, say something.

385
00:20:17,576 --> 00:20:18,809
Ooh!

386
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:24,848
Fantastic. I just poured
my heart out to a frog.

387
00:20:24,883 --> 00:20:27,517
Okay, where did she go?

388
00:20:27,553 --> 00:20:30,454
Pascal, you do realize that if
the king finds out she's gone,

389
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:31,688
we're all going to be
in big trouble right?

390
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:34,858
I'm aware it's not protocol, Pete,

391
00:20:34,893 --> 00:20:37,794
I just happen to think it
highlights my mustache.

392
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,530
Hey, Stan, great look!

393
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:42,466
I mean it really brings out the stache!

394
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:46,770
All right, you got us all here.

395
00:20:46,805 --> 00:20:48,672
What's this plan of yours?

396
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:50,874
Oh, it's not my plan, boys.

397
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:53,643
It's Lady Caine's plan.

398
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,512
Did he say Lady Caine?

399
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:59,483
See, 18 years ago the princess
was taken from Corona,

400
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:02,652
and it was because of her
the king unfairly cracked down

401
00:21:02,688 --> 00:21:06,656
on all those he considered undesirable.

402
00:21:06,692 --> 00:21:07,791
Us.

403
00:21:07,826 --> 00:21:09,826
Yeah, so?

404
00:21:09,862 --> 00:21:12,629
Gentleman, Lady Caine is promising

405
00:21:12,664 --> 00:21:15,499
not only to make you all rich,

406
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:17,834
but is offering you the opportunity

407
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,470
to exact revenge on the king

408
00:21:20,506 --> 00:21:22,806
and his precious little princess.

409
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,676
So, who's in?

410
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:38,622
Is that a secret passage?

411
00:21:38,657 --> 00:21:41,892
It was before you announced it
to the whole castle.

412
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:43,760
Rapunzel?

413
00:21:43,795 --> 00:21:45,929
Rapunzel?

414
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:48,498
Rapunzel, are you in there?

415
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:49,799
(clears throat)

416
00:21:49,835 --> 00:21:51,868
Is who in there, Eugene?

417
00:21:51,904 --> 00:21:53,770
Huh? Uh, no one.

418
00:21:53,805 --> 00:21:56,681
This is just part of my nightly routine.

419
00:21:56,717 --> 00:21:58,642
You know? Yeah, checking
the castle for intruders,

420
00:21:58,677 --> 00:22:00,315
keeping an eye on Rapunzel,
like I promised.

421
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,579
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, is anyone in there?

422
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,040
No? Good!

423
00:22:04,065 --> 00:22:05,206
See?

424
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,828
- The system works, really well I think...
- Eugene...

425
00:22:07,853 --> 00:22:09,819
Where is Rapunzel?

426
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:13,657
Uh, ah... in her room of course.

427
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:15,567
Good. I'd like to speak with her.

428
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:17,602
You can't!

429
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:19,638
I mean, you can, obviously...

430
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:21,640
you can do whatever you want.
You're the king!

431
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:25,443
A very large, intimidating, beardy,

432
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:28,613
yet clearly understanding, King.

433
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:30,749
It's just, she's still upset

434
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:32,851
and she said she needed time alone.

435
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:35,654
I was only trying to respect that.

436
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:38,590
But, like I said, you are the king,

437
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,662
the very sweet and non-hostile king.

438
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:48,900
Well, maybe she does need
some time to herself,

439
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:52,704
but when you see her please tell
her that I am looking for her.

440
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:55,473
Sir, about the whole proposal earlier.

441
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:57,576
That didn't go quite as I had hoped.

442
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:59,888
We'll discuss that later, son,

443
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:02,306
much later.

444
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:05,462
Right, we both have bigger fish to fry.

445
00:23:10,438 --> 00:23:12,471
That was so fun!

446
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:14,573
I'd like to take this
opportunity to remind you that

447
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:17,476
we're supposed to be sneaking out.

448
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:19,445
Cass, I think you'll discover that

449
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,580
I can be pretty sneaky when I need to...

450
00:23:23,718 --> 00:23:25,384
Nightly patrols.

451
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,686
We can get by them if we time it right.

452
00:23:26,721 --> 00:23:30,322
Wait, how did you know they were coming?

453
00:23:30,358 --> 00:23:32,558
I have eyes in the sky.

454
00:23:32,593 --> 00:23:35,695
(owl hooting)

455
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:39,432
That is amazing.

456
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:41,333
You have your own owl.

457
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:42,334
What's his name?

458
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:44,403
Owl.

459
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:46,439
(clicks tongue)

460
00:23:48,576 --> 00:23:49,642
Max!

461
00:23:49,677 --> 00:23:52,278
Yeah, when he heard
I was sneaking you out of here

462
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:54,480
he insisted he come along.

463
00:23:54,515 --> 00:23:55,748
And between you and me,

464
00:23:55,783 --> 00:23:58,350
I think he's got something
for you know who.

465
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,388
Hmm, it'll be our secret.

466
00:24:22,343 --> 00:24:23,542
(sighs)

467
00:24:23,578 --> 00:24:25,444
Oh honey, stop beating yourself up.

468
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,413
Rapunzel just needs some space.

469
00:24:27,448 --> 00:24:30,716
Nobody said dealing with
teenagers would be easy.

470
00:24:30,752 --> 00:24:32,651
Teenager or not, Ariana,

471
00:24:32,687 --> 00:24:34,687
she will be queen one day.

472
00:24:34,722 --> 00:24:37,323
I have to prepare her for that.

473
00:24:40,495 --> 00:24:42,361
(baby crying)

474
00:24:42,396 --> 00:24:43,729
King Frederic: <i>Guards, guards.</i>

no one can ever know I took you
outside the walls of Corona.

512
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:05,404
Don't worry!
No one is going to find out.

513
00:27:11,712 --> 00:27:13,479
(ground rumbling)

514
00:27:13,514 --> 00:27:15,447
Whoa! Whoa, Max.

515
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:17,616
All right, this looks dangerous.
Can you...

516
00:27:17,652 --> 00:27:20,519
can you stay here
and watch Fidela for me?

517
00:27:30,498 --> 00:27:33,299
So, what did you want to show me?

518
00:27:34,468 --> 00:27:37,269
Believe me, it's better
if you see it for yourself.

519
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:43,609
They're beautiful.

520
00:27:43,644 --> 00:27:45,311
What are they?

521
00:27:45,346 --> 00:27:47,479
Don't know. They just
kind of sprouted up here

522
00:27:47,515 --> 00:27:48,714
about a year ago.

523
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:50,649
And watch this...

524
00:27:50,685 --> 00:27:54,286
Uh, you might want to
stand back for this one.

525
00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:55,287
(grunts)

526
00:27:56,324 --> 00:27:57,389
Wow!

527
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,590
They're unbreakable.

528
00:27:58,626 --> 00:28:00,592
Want to know the weirdest part?

529
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,467
This is where they found
the miracle flower

530
00:28:08,502 --> 00:28:10,302
that saved your mom.

531
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:11,470
And me.

532
00:28:50,344 --> 00:28:51,343
Wait! What is...

533
00:28:51,379 --> 00:28:53,679
Get to the horses as fast as you can
and don't look back, Rapunzel.

534
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,553
Don't stop, Rapunzel. Keep going!

535
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,604
Um, Cassandra!

536
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:20,572
Keep moving, Rapunzel. We need to get...

537
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:22,408
Whoa! What?

538
00:29:29,606 --> 00:29:30,873
What happened?

539
00:29:30,897 --> 00:29:32,568
I have no idea,

540
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:34,002
but we'll have to deal with it later.

541
00:29:34,037 --> 00:29:35,904
Let's go!

542
00:29:48,852 --> 00:29:50,018
(grunts)

543
00:29:51,654 --> 00:29:52,720
Help!

544
00:29:52,756 --> 00:29:54,923
Cassandra! My hair!

545
00:30:34,965 --> 00:30:36,831
Whoa!

546
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:16,671
Ahh!

547
00:31:18,642 --> 00:31:19,808
Cassandra!

548
00:31:19,843 --> 00:31:21,509
Whoa!

549
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,707
See? I told you I'd get you in and out

550
00:31:30,732 --> 00:31:31,920
without anyone knowing.

551
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:33,262
Piece of cake.

552
00:31:33,313 --> 00:31:34,556
Piece of cake?

553
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:36,934
Uh, did you see the 70 feet of

554
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:38,110
"my father's going to kill me,"

555
00:31:38,145 --> 00:31:39,945
growing from my head?

556
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,947
One problem at a time please.

557
00:31:45,953 --> 00:31:47,052
We've got a problem.

558
00:31:47,087 --> 00:31:48,954
Because of the coronation,
they've doubled security

559
00:31:48,989 --> 00:31:50,155
at the gates today.

560
00:31:50,191 --> 00:31:51,924
And there's no other way in?

561
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:54,847
Sure, if you want to walk in the
front door in broad daylight.

562
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,256
Hmm, maybe we don't need the front door.

563
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:13,912
(snorts)

564
00:32:16,516 --> 00:32:18,316
I told him it wasn't protocol, sir.

565
00:32:28,662 --> 00:32:30,295
(grunts)

566
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,731
Okay, quick, hand me the scissors.

567
00:32:34,368 --> 00:32:35,634
So what do we wanna do here?

568
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:37,669
Maybe a bob? How about some layers?

569
00:32:37,704 --> 00:32:39,337
Just cut it!

570
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,743
Uh-oh.

571
00:32:44,778 --> 00:32:46,611
Uh-oh? Why uh-oh?

572
00:32:46,647 --> 00:32:48,513
There shouldn't be any uh-ohs.

573
00:32:49,683 --> 00:32:50,682
Uh-oh.

574
00:32:50,717 --> 00:32:52,550
Was your hair always this strong?

575
00:32:52,586 --> 00:32:53,863
What? No!

576
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,520
Try again.

577
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,656
(grunts)

578
00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:02,048
We're gonna need a plan B.

579
00:33:05,432 --> 00:33:06,398
Cover your eyes.

580
00:33:09,436 --> 00:33:10,568
Ha!

581
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:25,417
Forget it.

582
00:33:25,452 --> 00:33:27,552
It's just like those stupid
rocks. It's unbreakable.

583
00:33:27,587 --> 00:33:29,421
We can't forget it!

584
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:31,323
Today is my coronation.

585
00:33:31,358 --> 00:33:32,457
(knock on door)

586
00:33:32,492 --> 00:33:35,293
Hey, sunshine, are you in there?

587
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:36,661
You can't let Eugene see you.

588
00:33:36,697 --> 00:33:37,762
What? Why?

589
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:39,564
He can't know anything about last night.

590
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:40,832
I told you, Rapunzel.

591
00:33:40,867 --> 00:33:43,535
If it gets out that I took you
outside Corona, I'm done for.

592
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,769
But I trust Eugene.

593
00:33:44,805 --> 00:33:46,404
Well, I don't.

594
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,473
My dad will have me
taken off princess detail.

595
00:33:48,508 --> 00:33:50,775
We'll never see each other again.

596
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:52,677
Eugene: Oh come on, we've been
looking for you all night.

597
00:33:57,384 --> 00:33:58,683
Hey, are you okay in there?

598
00:33:58,719 --> 00:33:59,751
I can hear you, you know?

599
00:33:59,786 --> 00:34:01,486
(screams) Rapunzel!

600
00:34:03,357 --> 00:34:04,389
Rapunzel?

601
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:07,258
Rapunzel?

602
00:34:08,362 --> 00:34:09,694
Stand back!

603
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:12,697
Are you ok... Holy hair!

604
00:34:19,673 --> 00:34:21,439
(laughs)

605
00:34:21,475 --> 00:34:23,475
Surprise!

606
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,344
Whoa! Ooh, mama! Ha!

607
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,346
Okay! Okay.

608
00:34:28,382 --> 00:34:29,714
This is new, I mean, no! Not new.

609
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,416
Right? Because we've
seen this, obviously.

610
00:34:31,451 --> 00:34:32,917
That whole magic thing
is involved again.

611
00:34:32,953 --> 00:34:35,353
It was magic right? Actually, you
know what? You don't need to tell me.

612
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:37,422
I'm just going to go ahead and say
your hair magically grew back.

613
00:34:37,457 --> 00:34:39,457
I'm not going to ask how. Obviously
you don't want to tell me

614
00:34:39,493 --> 00:34:41,393
or else you wouldn't have
to tried to hide it from me.

615
00:34:41,428 --> 00:34:42,527
So, I won't ask how it grew back,

616
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:43,762
but tell me please,
how did it grow back?

617
00:34:43,797 --> 00:34:45,663
Don't answer that. The important
thing is you're okay.

618
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:48,600
You're okay, right? Because as long as
you're okay, I don't care what happened.

619
00:34:48,635 --> 00:34:50,368
But I mean, I care, obviously I care,

620
00:34:50,404 --> 00:34:51,703
but I'm sure there is
a reasonable explanation.

621
00:34:51,738 --> 00:34:53,438
Where is the war?

622
00:34:53,473 --> 00:34:54,572
That you'll share when you're ready.

623
00:34:55,642 --> 00:34:57,409
Thank you for understanding.

624
00:34:57,444 --> 00:34:59,310
Oh, come one, really?

625
00:34:59,346 --> 00:35:00,712
I thought we trusted
each other, Rapunzel.

626
00:35:00,747 --> 00:35:03,715
We do! I do, it's just...

627
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,517
Fine, fine, fine. You know what?

628
00:35:05,552 --> 00:35:07,318
I can't make you tell me what happened,

629
00:35:07,354 --> 00:35:10,255
but obviously you're keeping
something from me.

630
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,357
But whatever it is,
I just want you to know

631
00:35:12,392 --> 00:35:15,493
you should never feel like you
have to hide anything from me.

632
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,600
You don't hide things
from the people you love.

633
00:35:22,636 --> 00:35:24,569
Ever.

634
00:35:24,604 --> 00:35:25,670
Queen Arianna: Rapunzel, honey.

635
00:35:25,705 --> 00:35:27,572
Hide your hair, woman!

636
00:35:27,607 --> 00:35:28,673
You gotta hid your hair.

637
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:30,575
Rapunzel?

638
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,677
May I come in, sweetheart?

639
00:35:35,649 --> 00:35:37,715
You can't! I'm...

640
00:35:37,751 --> 00:35:39,551
brushing my teeth!

641
00:35:39,586 --> 00:35:41,352
Queen Arianna: Oh, good.

642
00:35:41,388 --> 00:35:43,588
But I can still come in, can't I?

643
00:35:43,623 --> 00:35:46,357
Believe me Mom, you do not want to.

644
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:47,525
Morning breath.

645
00:35:47,561 --> 00:35:50,562
Wouldn't wanna expose you to that.

646
00:35:50,597 --> 00:35:53,331
That's ah, very thoughtful of you.

647
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:57,402
Um, Dad and I want you to join
us on the terrace for breakfast.

648
00:35:57,437 --> 00:35:58,770
Um, I don't know.

649
00:35:58,805 --> 00:36:02,574
There's a lot of stuff
I have to do to get ready.

650
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:04,476
Queen Arianna: Rapunzel, well,

651
00:36:04,511 --> 00:36:07,278
your father has something very
important to share with you.

652
00:36:07,314 --> 00:36:09,581
He's... he's been waiting all night.

653
00:36:09,616 --> 00:36:12,517
Yeah, sure, um...

654
00:36:12,552 --> 00:36:14,719
I will meet you there in a minute?

655
00:36:16,623 --> 00:36:19,257
The coronation is in two hours!

656
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:21,559
How am I suppose to cut this hair?

657
00:36:25,532 --> 00:36:27,599
I might have an idea.

658
00:36:29,703 --> 00:36:33,671
So, Rapunzel, ready for the big day?

659
00:36:33,707 --> 00:36:37,442
You bet! Already
into the princess spirit.

660
00:36:37,477 --> 00:36:40,445
The bigger the wig,
the better the princess, right?

661
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,062
So Dad, Mom said you wanted to talk.

662
00:36:43,087 --> 00:36:45,416
Yes... Rapunzel, last night,

663
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:47,385
your mother and I had a discussion.

664
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,553
(sighs)

665
00:36:48,588 --> 00:36:50,722
I know that I'm not
always able to separate

666
00:36:50,757 --> 00:36:52,590
the man from the king

667
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:54,492
and separating the father from the king

668
00:36:54,528 --> 00:36:56,694
has proven even more difficult.

669
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,329
(sighs)

670
00:36:58,365 --> 00:37:00,431
Sweetheart, I know this

671
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:02,734
new life is hard to get used to,

672
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:04,602
and I'm sure that sometimes you wish

673
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:05,637
I would get out of your hair.

674
00:37:05,672 --> 00:37:07,338
(coughs)

675
00:37:07,374 --> 00:37:08,540
Ooh, sorry.

676
00:37:08,575 --> 00:37:10,508
It's a little, um, dry out here.

677
00:37:10,544 --> 00:37:12,343
Anyone else dry?

678
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:13,711
Rapunzel,

679
00:37:13,747 --> 00:37:16,347
you are going to be queen someday.

680
00:37:16,383 --> 00:37:19,384
A great queen with a
magnificent kingdom.

681
00:37:19,419 --> 00:37:21,286
But you know better than anyone else

682
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:23,288
what a dangerous and evil place

683
00:37:23,323 --> 00:37:25,256
the world can be.

684
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:26,658
And the barrier keeping
us safe from that

685
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:29,427
is sometimes more fragile
than it appears.

686
00:37:29,462 --> 00:37:31,496
When that evil rears its ugly head

687
00:37:31,531 --> 00:37:34,432
it is my job to protect Corona from it.

688
00:37:34,467 --> 00:37:37,569
And one day, that will be
your responsibility.

689
00:37:37,604 --> 00:37:39,704
And I must teach you how to carry it.

690
00:37:39,739 --> 00:37:42,407
But that is many, many years away.

691
00:37:42,442 --> 00:37:45,543
Until that burden is imposed on you,

692
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:47,612
I'm asking that you trust me

693
00:37:47,647 --> 00:37:50,281
that I know how to
keep danger as far away

694
00:37:50,317 --> 00:37:51,716
from you and this kingdom

695
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:53,551
as is humanly possible.

696
00:37:53,587 --> 00:37:55,286
Do you understand?

697
00:37:55,322 --> 00:37:57,455
It was until last night that I realized

698
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:00,425
that my methods may have at times seemed

699
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,760
strict or unfair or...

700
00:38:02,796 --> 00:38:05,363
Does this mean I can have
more time to myself

701
00:38:05,398 --> 00:38:08,299
without having half the royal
guard over my shoulder?

702
00:38:08,335 --> 00:38:10,335
Well, this means I'm willing

703
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,570
to reconsider those methods.

704
00:38:12,606 --> 00:38:14,305
But I make no promises.

705
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:16,441
I can work with that.

706
00:38:17,711 --> 00:38:19,377
(sniffs)

707
00:38:19,412 --> 00:38:21,245
Well, I should go.

708
00:38:21,281 --> 00:38:23,581
I have a lot of princessing up to do.

709
00:38:23,617 --> 00:38:25,516
(chuckles)

710
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,686
You're right, Arianna.

711
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:31,489
Teenagers are a whole new frontier.

712
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,392
How are ya?

713
00:38:37,364 --> 00:38:44,302
(whistling "Ode to Joy")

714
00:38:44,337 --> 00:38:45,503
Oh, come on!

715
00:38:45,538 --> 00:38:47,372
What is going on with Rapunzel?

716
00:38:47,407 --> 00:38:48,573
I mean, is it something I did?

717
00:38:48,608 --> 00:38:49,707
Probably.

718
00:38:49,743 --> 00:38:52,710
And since when did she
start keeping secrets from me?

719
00:38:52,746 --> 00:38:55,513
Hey, Fitzherbert, I need to get
this done before the coronation,

720
00:38:55,548 --> 00:38:57,548
so do you mind throwing your
pity party someplace else?

721
00:38:57,584 --> 00:38:59,584
Look, Cassandra,

722
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:02,286
I know you don't like me for Rapunzel...

723
00:39:02,322 --> 00:39:03,421
Oh, that's not true.

724
00:39:03,456 --> 00:39:04,689
I don't like you for anyone.

725
00:39:04,724 --> 00:39:06,391
I just want what's best for her.

726
00:39:06,426 --> 00:39:07,659
You don't say!

727
00:39:07,694 --> 00:39:09,661
Of course! I want her to feel safe.

728
00:39:09,696 --> 00:39:12,630
I want her to be taken care of
and I want her to be happy here.

729
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:15,433
Funny, you seem to have
a pretty good handle

730
00:39:15,468 --> 00:39:16,668
on the things you want.

731
00:39:21,574 --> 00:39:23,255
Oh, don't you start.

732
00:39:26,413 --> 00:39:28,579
(knock on door)

733
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:30,161
Hi, honey.

734
00:39:30,186 --> 00:39:31,716
Oh, hi Mom.

735
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:34,318
You left so quickly after breakfast I...

736
00:39:34,354 --> 00:39:36,554
I didn't have a chance
to give this to you.

737
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:40,625
I know it's a little early
for a coronation gift but...

738
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,695
I thought you might like to see it now.

739
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,434
18th of July...

740
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:54,605
We embarked on a safari to the most
remote plains of the third continent.

741
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:56,274
21st of May...

742
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:58,609
Had to take shelter in a hidden cave

743
00:39:58,645 --> 00:40:01,312
to escape the fury of a violent storm.

744
00:40:01,347 --> 00:40:02,580
12th of April...

745
00:40:02,615 --> 00:40:06,284
Helped villagers rebuild
their war torn homes.

746
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,519
Mom, is this yours?

747
00:40:08,555 --> 00:40:11,389
Did you actually do all this?

748
00:40:11,424 --> 00:40:12,623
Rapunzel,

749
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:14,726
before I met your father,

750
00:40:14,761 --> 00:40:17,361
I was so much like you.

751
00:40:17,397 --> 00:40:20,732
I had no idea what I was
supposed to do in this world.

752
00:40:20,767 --> 00:40:24,769
So I went out and found my own way.

753
00:40:27,707 --> 00:40:30,408
You're father is right about one thing,

754
00:40:30,443 --> 00:40:32,543
You will be queen someday,

755
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:34,479
but only you get to decide

756
00:40:34,514 --> 00:40:36,314
what kind of queen you'll be.

757
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:39,450
And no one can tell you the
best way to make that decision.

758
00:40:39,486 --> 00:40:41,786
But how can I if...

759
00:40:41,821 --> 00:40:43,521
Wait...

760
00:40:43,556 --> 00:40:45,656
- are you suggesting that I should...
- Honey...

761
00:40:45,692 --> 00:40:48,459
find a way to fill those pages.

762
00:40:48,495 --> 00:40:50,528
I only ask that you be safe,

763
00:40:50,563 --> 00:40:53,564
be smart, and above all...

764
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,399
be true to yourself.

765
00:40:59,472 --> 00:41:01,539
<i>Plus est en vous?</i>

766
00:41:01,574 --> 00:41:03,541
<i>Plus est en vous.</i>

767
00:41:03,576 --> 00:41:06,544
It means, "There is more in you."

768
00:41:20,627 --> 00:41:22,460
This would have been so much easier

769
00:41:22,495 --> 00:41:23,661
with the other girls helping,

770
00:41:23,696 --> 00:41:24,796
but they're such gossips,

771
00:41:24,831 --> 00:41:26,631
half the kingdom would know
about your hair by now.

772
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:28,499
Are you sure you can't see it?

773
00:41:29,602 --> 00:41:32,470
Positive. Are you sure
you can pull this off?

774
00:41:40,713 --> 00:41:42,713
I have to, Cassandra.

775
00:41:42,749 --> 00:41:44,782
Just be careful you don't trip on this.

776
00:41:44,818 --> 00:41:48,352
It's not the dress I'm worried about.

777
00:41:48,388 --> 00:41:50,755
How do people walk in these things?

778
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,657
Whoa! (sighs)

779
00:41:52,692 --> 00:41:54,325
Just relax.

780
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,460
This is going to be fine.

781
00:41:56,496 --> 00:41:58,596
I can't wait any longer.

782
00:41:58,631 --> 00:42:00,731
This better work, Pocket.

783
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:02,767
Don't you worry, boys.

784
00:42:02,802 --> 00:42:05,603
Lady Caine will not disappoint.

785
00:42:10,677 --> 00:42:11,742
Okay.

786
00:42:22,388 --> 00:42:23,354
Wow.

787
00:42:31,598 --> 00:42:33,431
Whoa! (chuckles)

788
00:42:33,466 --> 00:42:34,632
Whoa!

789
00:42:38,404 --> 00:42:39,637
Oh, whoa!

790
00:42:39,672 --> 00:42:42,506
How embarrassing for her.

791
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:44,709
This is going to take forever.

792
00:42:56,456 --> 00:42:59,323
Hello? Can anyone help me?

793
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:03,394
Silly me, I must've taken
a wrong turn somewhere.

794
00:43:03,429 --> 00:43:05,396
I'll be glad to help you, madam.

795
00:43:05,431 --> 00:43:09,333
Oh, you're too kind!

796
00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:10,601
(moans)

797
00:43:15,341 --> 00:43:16,741
Hey, Madam Poppycock?

798
00:43:16,776 --> 00:43:18,476
The party's upstairs.

799
00:43:19,712 --> 00:43:22,580
Meet Lady Caine.

800
00:43:22,615 --> 00:43:25,383
You're a lot stronger than you look.

801
00:43:26,486 --> 00:43:28,319
I'm a lot of things.

802
00:43:30,556 --> 00:43:32,657
Let the show begin.

803
00:43:32,692 --> 00:43:35,593
I'm gonna need you to step back
into that cell, pronto.

804
00:43:37,764 --> 00:43:41,465
That there is a nice suit.

805
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:47,192
The wearer of this crown

806
00:43:47,228 --> 00:43:49,736
is a shining example of the promise

807
00:43:49,764 --> 00:43:51,353
that is Corona,

808
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,132
an ambassador of goodwill

809
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:55,034
to those visiting from afar,

810
00:43:55,069 --> 00:43:57,136
and an inspiration

811
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:59,138
to those fortunate enough

812
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:01,774
to live within her borders.

813
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:05,077
But above all, the chief
responsibility of the crown

814
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:08,614
is to keep the people of Corona safe

815
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:10,443
from dangers, near and far.

816
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:12,685
And their are many.

817
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,887
This mandate is not to be taken

818
00:44:14,922 --> 00:44:16,522
- lightly.
- Go find Max.

819
00:44:16,557 --> 00:44:19,825
There will come a day when
the walls that surround Corona

820
00:44:19,861 --> 00:44:23,429
are threatened by malfeasance. A day...

821
00:44:23,464 --> 00:44:26,465
- Attention, please!
- Lady Caine?

822
00:44:28,703 --> 00:44:29,835
(screaming)

823
00:44:39,881 --> 00:44:41,814
Release my guests immediately.

824
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:43,816
What's the matter, Fred?

825
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:46,685
Am I ruining your
little girl's perfect day?

826
00:44:46,721 --> 00:44:48,454
The duchess?

827
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:51,790
Oh honey, I am no duchess.

828
00:44:51,826 --> 00:44:53,459
I don't understand.

829
00:44:53,494 --> 00:44:55,694
Of course you wouldn't, Rapunzel.

830
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:58,597
But try to follow along.

831
00:44:58,633 --> 00:45:01,700
This is all your fault.

832
00:45:01,736 --> 00:45:02,801
What?

833
00:45:02,837 --> 00:45:06,605
You see, after your
untimely disappearance,

834
00:45:06,641 --> 00:45:09,808
Your father locked up every
criminal in the kingdom,

835
00:45:09,844 --> 00:45:12,678
including a simple petty thief.

836
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:14,847
My father...

837
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:16,715
I saw him thrown into a cage

838
00:45:16,751 --> 00:45:18,551
and hauled off like some animal,

839
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:19,818
never to be seen again.

840
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:23,856
So, I thought I'd come back

841
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:25,624
and return the favor.

842
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:33,566
Load 'em up, boys.

843
00:45:37,939 --> 00:45:40,673
Your turn, Your Majesty.

844
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:43,609
Oh come now,

845
00:45:43,644 --> 00:45:47,846
you didn't think we'd leave our
prized pig in the pen, did you?

846
00:45:47,882 --> 00:45:49,448
Dad?

847
00:45:49,483 --> 00:45:50,616
Rapunzel, stay back.

848
00:45:50,651 --> 00:45:52,785
- But...
- No. There's nothing you can do.

849
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:56,622
As your father and your king,
I command you to stay put.

850
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:01,927
Don't be a hero, pretty boy.

851
00:46:11,872 --> 00:46:14,573
Sorry, Dad...

852
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:16,475
I can't stay put.

853
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:17,843
Rapunzel!

854
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:32,424
That's my girl!

855
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,793
Let them go!

856
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:42,901
(chuckles) It's amazing what
you can hide under those wigs,

857
00:46:42,937 --> 00:46:44,603
isn't it, Princess.

858
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:46,905
Come on, let's move out!

859
00:46:53,547 --> 00:46:55,814
Ugh, now you're just making me angry.

860
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:58,717
Good, because I'm just getting started.

861
00:47:00,955 --> 00:47:04,590
Get those people back here, now!

862
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:06,558
Rapunzel, your hair!

863
00:47:06,594 --> 00:47:07,826
I know, we'll talk about it later.

864
00:47:07,862 --> 00:47:10,729
Please get somewhere safe
and take care of Mom.

865
00:47:10,765 --> 00:47:12,798
- Rapunzel!
- That's my cue...

866
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:14,500
Yeah!

867
00:47:14,535 --> 00:47:16,669
Well, my last day on princess duty.

868
00:47:16,704 --> 00:47:18,537
Might as well go down fighting.

869
00:47:24,512 --> 00:47:25,844
Leave them alone.

870
00:47:30,551 --> 00:47:31,884
So, you sure you can handle yourself?

871
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:33,552
Oh, I'll manage.

872
00:47:40,628 --> 00:47:42,828
Get that door open, now!

873
00:48:02,883 --> 00:48:05,551
Aw... cute.

874
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,606
Rapunzel!

875
00:48:41,522 --> 00:48:42,588
Thanks, blondie.

876
00:48:54,571 --> 00:48:56,838
Haha! Now this feels good.

877
00:49:11,588 --> 00:49:13,521
Stay down!

878
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:18,560
You have no idea
who you are dealing with.

879
00:49:18,595 --> 00:49:21,429
Believe me, I've dealt with much worse.

880
00:49:24,768 --> 00:49:26,501
You think this is over?

881
00:49:26,536 --> 00:49:28,636
Ha! I promise you,

882
00:49:28,672 --> 00:49:29,838
I'll be back.

883
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:33,641
Oh... (tsking) Lady Caine.

884
00:49:33,677 --> 00:49:35,610
It's impolite to leave
in the middle of a party.

885
00:49:35,645 --> 00:49:38,413
You think you'd know that.

886
00:49:40,517 --> 00:49:43,485
(cheers and applause)

887
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:51,659
Nice to see ya. Thanks for coming!

888
00:49:51,695 --> 00:49:52,861
Nice suit, buddy.

889
00:49:52,896 --> 00:49:54,629
Happy Coronation Day folks.

890
00:50:06,843 --> 00:50:09,844
So I'm trying to understand this.

891
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,813
You snuck out last night

892
00:50:11,848 --> 00:50:13,848
went beyond the walls of Corona,

893
00:50:13,884 --> 00:50:16,885
where you touched a mysterious rock,

894
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,555
that somehow caused your hair to return?

895
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:21,756
Yes.

896
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:23,658
And you acted alone?

897
00:50:23,693 --> 00:50:25,794
Look, I know you're angry,

898
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:28,696
but can't you see? I'm okay!

899
00:50:28,732 --> 00:50:30,598
I'm more than okay, I...

900
00:50:30,634 --> 00:50:32,801
Rapunzel...

901
00:50:34,771 --> 00:50:36,671
There's something I need to tell you.

902
00:50:37,874 --> 00:50:39,541
I love you.

903
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:44,512
The night you were taken,
a part of me died,

904
00:50:44,548 --> 00:50:46,481
the best part of me.

905
00:50:46,516 --> 00:50:49,884
For 18 long and agonizing years I swore

906
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,621
that if somehow,
someway, by some miracle

907
00:50:53,657 --> 00:50:57,592
the fates decided to show mercy
and return you to me,

908
00:50:57,627 --> 00:51:00,695
I would never let anything
happen to you again.

909
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:02,931
And now that this has returned,

910
00:51:02,966 --> 00:51:06,768
the very reason you were snatched
away from me in the first place,

911
00:51:06,803 --> 00:51:09,838
I'm afraid I'm left
with no choice, sweetheart.

912
00:51:12,642 --> 00:51:13,741
As of tonight,

913
00:51:13,777 --> 00:51:16,478
I'm forced to exercise
my martial right as king

914
00:51:16,513 --> 00:51:19,481
to forbid you from leaving the walls
of this kingdom without my consent.

915
00:51:19,516 --> 00:51:21,483
- Father!
- And know this...

916
00:51:21,518 --> 00:51:24,719
This is the last we will
speak of mystical rocks

917
00:51:24,754 --> 00:51:27,822
or magic of any kind to anyone.

918
00:51:27,858 --> 00:51:29,491
Is that understood?

919
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,695
There is so much more
to me than you think.

920
00:51:47,511 --> 00:51:48,643
(knock on door)

921
00:51:48,678 --> 00:51:49,911
Come in.

922
00:51:49,946 --> 00:51:53,681
I believe somebody ordered room service?

923
00:51:53,717 --> 00:51:56,851
Eugene, how did you know?

924
00:51:56,887 --> 00:51:59,554
Ah, I had a feeling.

925
00:51:59,589 --> 00:52:01,556
Look, I just wanted
to clear some stuff up.

926
00:52:02,926 --> 00:52:04,726
I haven't had a chance to apologize for

927
00:52:04,761 --> 00:52:07,495
putting you on the spot
with that proposal.

928
00:52:07,531 --> 00:52:09,731
Well looking back,
storming out of the room

929
00:52:09,766 --> 00:52:12,800
probably wasn't the best reaction.

930
00:52:12,836 --> 00:52:16,604
So I'm sorry.

931
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,907
No, don't apologize.

932
00:52:18,942 --> 00:52:22,877
Look I'll admit, I don't quite
understand why you said "no."

933
00:52:22,913 --> 00:52:26,915
But I promise to do
everything I can until I do.

934
00:52:28,518 --> 00:52:29,651
Thanks, Eugene.

935
00:52:29,686 --> 00:52:31,519
In the mean time,

936
00:52:31,555 --> 00:52:34,856
we'll stay right here
and take things slowly.

937
00:52:34,891 --> 00:52:36,724
I miss this.

938
00:52:38,495 --> 00:52:40,762
Hey, promise me one more thing.

939
00:52:40,797 --> 00:52:41,896
Anything.

940
00:52:41,932 --> 00:52:44,832
That you'll be patient with me.

941
00:52:44,868 --> 00:52:46,801
Absolutely.

942
00:52:48,538 --> 00:52:49,704
Good night, Rapunzel.

943
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:51,506
